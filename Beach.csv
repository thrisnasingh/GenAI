You'll likely stick to the island where your resort is located, but you can expect pearlescent sands, towering palm trees, incredibly blue waters and surreal sunsets wherever you choose to lay down your towel. Because the Maldives is an Islamic nation, most public beaches require visitors to cover up, so those staying in guesthouses should consider Rasdhoo and Maafushi islands, which have designated tourist beaches where bikinis are allowed.

The area is popular with surfers in the winter, when the waves pick up size and speed."
,,"Grayton Beach, Florida","There is no shortage of beautiful beaches in Florida, the peninsula-state that boasts 1,350 miles of coastline shared between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea. Since beaches in Florida can get quite busy, we recommend going off the beaten path and into the panhandle to Grayton Beach in South Walton, between Pensacola and Panama City. Boasting 400 acres of fine white sand and a unique lake within the sand dunes that's perfect for kayakers, you can enjoy a less developed Florida beach and the adjacent town scores extra points for its quirky persona."
