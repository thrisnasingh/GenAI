# Travel Inspiration Generator

Welcome to our Generative AI Hackathon Project! Using the skills learned through the workshops of the Hackathon,
we were able to create an AI generated map of 200+ popular travel destinations grouped by similarity, such as all beaches grouped together and all winter destinations together.
We used Nomic's Atlas software to implement the map. Users can select a destination based on what characteristic they are interested in. 
Inside the map, for each travel destination, we've included a description of
the place and an AI generated image of the destination based on that description using Baseten's open-source AI
models. All data was generated through webscraping.
